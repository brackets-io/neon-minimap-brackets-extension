Neon Minimap Brackets Extension - 1.0.1
=========

### NOTICE: The Minimap extension now reacts to the current theme so this is useless. Don't use this. :smile:

### NOTICE: This extension is no longer going to be updated. ~~If the Neon theme updates you'll have to update the theme file manually. Also, this extension can really use any Brackets theme file, not just Neon's, so feel free to re-upload this extension with your own theme.~~

Screenshots are from Neon version 1.1.4
